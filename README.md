## Citywide Immunization Registry and Reporting:
Since 1996, the Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR) has been used as a database of patient immunization records submitted by NYC health care providers. It is accessible to authorized health care providers, schools, individuals, and agencies concerned with public health to help ensure that NYC residents receive all recommended immunizations. NYC health care providers report immunizations to the CIR as mandated by New York State (NYS) Public Health Law and the NYC Health Code. Pediatric providers are required to report all immunizations administered to children 0-18 years. Reporting adult immunizations requires consent. However, on July 29, 2022, the consent requirement was suspended by the [Governor&apos;s executive order](https://www.governor.ny.gov/executive-order/no-20-declaring-disaster-state-new-york) and the [Health Commissioner&apos;s order](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/monkeypox/monkeypox-order-reporting-vaccination-information.pdf) (PDF). These orders required providers to report all monkeypox vaccinations (for a child or adult) to the CIR.

## Reporting Timing:
Beginning September 9, 2022, NYC DOHMH began using the CIR as the main data source for tracking monkeypox vaccinations administered. The shift in data sources reflected the suspension of the CIR consent requirement by the Governor’s executive order and the Health Commissioner’s order described above. Data published prior to September 9, 2022 were a compilation of data sources from all vaccinating entities in NYC. Data were shared with NYC DOHMH under data use agreements with the vaccinating entities.

Data published daily include entries recorded in the CIR by 3 PM the previous day. Providers are required to report monkeypox vaccine doses to the CIR within 72 hours of administration. Despite the requirements, reporting delays still exist due to technical difficulties in reporting for some providers. Therefore, our counts may underestimate the actual number of monkeypox vaccine doses administered in NYC for the most recent days.

#### Update as of 11/01/2022 
As of 11/01/2022, data reported by DOHMH using the Citywide Immunization Registry may be incomplete due to changes in vaccine reporting requirements. 

## Report Date Versus Date of Event:
Immunization data are published by date of vaccination event. Vaccination data may be entered into CIR several days after the vaccine was administered. Therefore, new records reported to CIR each day contain a mix of vaccines that were administered the day prior, as well as vaccines that were administered on previous days.
This approach may differ from data published by other state and local health departments. Publishing data by date of event better reflects when things happened, as opposed to when the Health Department learned about them. We strongly discourage data users from using daily changes to cumulative files as trend data, as this represents information by report date and is prone to misuse and misinterpretation.

## Vaccine Eligibility:
Due to limited vaccine supply during the initial stages of the outbreak, eligibility criteria for priority groups were instituted.

## Definitions: 
- **Doses Administered:** The number of monkeypox vaccine doses that have been administered in NYC and reported to the CIR. This includes doses administered to NYC residents and non-NYC residents. 
- **Dose Number:** Dose information is determined by the sequence of date of vaccination event in the CIR. Data are broken out by the two-dose JYENNEOS vaccine series. 
  - **Dose 1:** First dose of a two-dose vaccine series
  - **Dose 2:** Second dose of a two-dose vaccine series
